Dota 2 Settings Transferer

This program allows to quickly and easily transfer you Dota settings 
TO and FROM any account you ever logged in to on this PC.

INITIAL SETTING (optional):

Initial setting is saving the settings from
one of your accounts.
If you don't do this, configuration will be saved automatically,
from the first account you ever logged in to.
To save the configuration manaully choose "3)Save configuraion",
then choose ID of the account FROM which you need to save the settings.
Accounts are listed in order they were added on the computed, so first of them is most likely your main.
How to get your account ID is described below, in Manual transfer paragraph.

HOW TO USE:

You can transfer settings automatically or manually.
1) Auto transfer
  When auto transfering you don't need to do basically anything. Your saved configuration will tranfer by itself
  in the current account (or the last account you logged in to)
2) Manual transfer
  When manual transfering, you will need to choose the account TO which you need to transfer settings.
  ID of the account can be seen in Dota, or in your Steam profile, in the address bar, 
  if you previously tick Steam -> Settings -> Interface -> Display web address bars when avalible.
  If the ID in address bar is literal and not numeric, you can get your numeric ID with help of this website:
  https://steamid.xyz/
  You need to enter you literal ID and press "Submit" (or whatever the button is called). The ID you need is in the Steam32 ID field

When logging in to the Steam account, or when launching Dota, Steam might find a discrepancy of data in cloud and on your PC,
and will ask which data to keep. Choose data on PC.
 

Good luck using D2ST!
